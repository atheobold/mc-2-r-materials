### Good!

- Students land directly in a project upon login
- Works well for workshops where all work will be completed in a single project
- Also great for sharing code in general, e.g. collaboration, reprexes, etc.
]

--

.pull-right[
### Not so good...

- Students need to remember to make a copy of the project (which means you need to remember to remind them!)
- You can't keep track which students started their assignment
- You can't easily peek into student projects -- they would need to explicitly share the project with you

### Good!

- Base projects with desired packages installed
- Assignments -- no more "make a copy of the project before starting work"
- Collaborate with students *inside* their projects
]

.pull-right[
### Not so good...

- Students land in the workspace, may need to provide instructions for the next steps
- Git config for each project can get tedious and doesn't reflect realistic practice

.huge[`learnr` Tutorials]

---

## `r emo::ji("package")` learnr

- **learnr** is an R package that makes it easy to create interactive tutorials
from R Markdown documents.

- Tutorials can include:
  - Narrative, figures, illustrations, and equations
  - Code exercises (R code chunks that users can edit and execute directly)
  - Multiple choice questions
  - Videos (YouTube, Vimeo)
  - Interactive Shiny components

- learnr is on CRAN

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("learnr")
```

.larger[Components of a `learnr` tutorial]


---

## YAML

Start with a YAML, just like in R Markdown:

```{r eval=FALSE}
---
title: "Starting with Data"
output: 
  learnr::tutorial:
    progressive: true
    allow_skip: true
runtime: shiny_prerendered
---
```

1. Create a new RMarkdown file
2. Select from Template
3. Choose the Interactive Tutorial template from `learnr`
4. Start editing! 

---

## Narrative

- R Markdown style section and subsection headings with `##`, `###`, etc.
- Text, figures, illustrations, and equations.
- Videos: supported services include YouTube and Vimeo

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height = "75%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/learnr-narrative.png")
```

---

## Multiple choice questions

```{r eval=FALSE}
quiz(
  question("What position is the letter A in the english alphabet?",
    answer("8"),
    answer("14"),
    answer("1", correct = TRUE),
    answer("23"),
    incorrect = "See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_alphabet) and try again.",
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),

  question("Where are you right now? (select ALL that apply)",
    answer("Planet Earth", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Pluto"),
    answer("At a computing device", correct = TRUE),
    answer("In the Milky Way", correct = TRUE),
    incorrect = paste0("Incorrect. You're on Earth, ",
                       "in the Milky Way, at a computer.")
  )
)
```

.huge[Questions to Ponder]

---

class: middle

# What are my resources?

* Does your university have server time for hosting `learnr` tutorials?

--

* If not, does your university have funding sources to host these things elsewhere?  (e.g. shinyapps.io)

--

* Can you acquire funding for RStudio Cloud?  Can you charge students to use it?

--

* How much do **you** enjoy creating / teaching with R resources?

---

class: middle

# What are my learning objectives?

* If **learning R** is one of them... 

...students should probably have a native install!

--

* If **understanding how statisticians use code** is one of them ...

... consider `learnr` tutorials with pre-supplied code or pre-made RS Cloud.

--

* If **software is not a learning objective**...

... consider using R as a back-end only, to make your own life easier.
