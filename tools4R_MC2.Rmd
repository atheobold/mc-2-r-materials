## `r emo::ji("package")` learnr

- **learnr** is an R package that makes it easy to create interactive tutorials from R Markdown documents.

- Tutorials can include:
  - Narrative, figures, illustrations, and equations
  - Code exercises (R code chunks that users can edit and execute directly)
  - Multiple choice questions
  - Videos (YouTube, Vimeo)
  - Interactive Shiny components

- learnr is on CRAN

```{r eval=FALSE}
install.packages("learnr")
```

## YAML

Start with a YAML, just like in R Markdown:

```{r eval=FALSE}
---
title: "Starting with Data"
output: 
  learnr::tutorial:
    progressive: true
    allow_skip: true
runtime: shiny_prerendered
---
```

1. Create a new RMarkdown file
2. Select from Template
3. Choose the Interactive Tutorial template from `learnr`
4. Start editing! 

---

## Narrative

- R Markdown style section and subsection headings with `##`, `###`, etc.
- Text, figures, illustrations, and equations.
- Videos: supported services include YouTube and Vimeo

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height = "75%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/learnr-narrative.png")
```

---

## Multiple choice questions

```{r eval=FALSE}
quiz(
  question("What position is the letter A in the english alphabet?",
    answer("8"),
    answer("14"),
    answer("1", correct = TRUE),
    answer("23"),
    incorrect = "See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_alphabet) and try again.",
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),

  question("Where are you right now? (select ALL that apply)",
    answer("Planet Earth", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Pluto"),
    answer("At a computing device", correct = TRUE),
    answer("In the Milky Way", correct = TRUE),
    incorrect = paste0("Incorrect. You're on Earth, ",
                       "in the Milky Way, at a computer.")
  )
)
```

.hand[Q: How do I share with my students?]
]

- Deploy on
  - shinyapps.io
  - RStudio Connect (free for academic use, requires setup)

- Essential reading:

  - [Publishing learnr Tutorials on shinyapps.io](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/learnr/vignettes/shinyapps-publishing.html) by Angela Li
  - [Teach R with learnr: a powerful tool for remote teaching](https://education.rstudio.com/blog/2020/05/learnr-for-remote/) by Allison Horst
  - See the [publishing instructions](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/publishing.html) on the learnr website for step-by-step instructions

.hand[Q: Where can I find more examples?]
]

* Both the learnr package and gradethis have a large number of examples, e.g.

```{r eval=FALSE}
gradethis::gradethis_demo()
```

* [RStudio Cloud Primers](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers) - these are all learnr tutorials and their code is available on [github](https://github.com/rstudio-education/primers).

* [Data Science in a Box](http://datasciencebox.org) - we will be adding learnr tutorials we develop here.

### lots of friction points

- Install R
- Install RStudio
- Install the following packages:
  - rmarkdown
  - tidyverse 
  - ...
- Load these packages
- Install git

.pull-right[
### much less friction

- Go to rstudio.cloud
- Log in

```{r hello-r, eval=FALSE}
