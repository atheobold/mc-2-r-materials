Do you want to install from **developer version** sources **as opposed to CRAN version** the package which needs compilation?

This means you're trying to update a package that's in use!

Clear out the **environment**, including "hidden objects"

Close other R/RStudio windows.

Try to install again.

Gen Z doesn't understand folders]
]

Things I have seen students do...

--

* Download a dataset to a random folder, expect it to be read into R automatically.

--

* Never **save** or **knit** their R Markdown file.  Lose everything when something crashes.

--

* Re-download the lab every time they want to work on it, open it from their downloads folder, copy paste code from a Google Doc.

--

* Re-download R or RStudio every time they want to open it.

Equality of assessment]
]


* Using a Studio computer means students taking exams out of their comfort zone...

--

* ... but troubleshooting individual laptops during an exam is impossible!

--

* Not all students can afford the most powerful computer.

--

* Not all students have a laptop computer they can bring to class.

## `r emo::ji("package")` learnr

- **learnr** is an R package that makes it easy to create interactive tutorials from R Markdown documents.

- Tutorials can include:
  - Narrative, figures, illustrations, and equations
  - Code exercises (R code chunks that users can edit and execute directly)
  - Multiple choice questions
  - Videos (YouTube, Vimeo)
  - Interactive Shiny components

- learnr is on CRAN

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("learnr")
```

---

## YAML

Start with a YAML, just like in R Markdown:

```{r eval=FALSE}
---
title: "Starting with Data"
output: 
  learnr::tutorial:
    progressive: true
    allow_skip: true
runtime: shiny_prerendered
---
```

1. Create a new RMarkdown file
2. Select from Template
3. Choose the Interactive Tutorial template from `learnr`
4. Start editing! 

---

## Narrative

- R Markdown style section and subsection headings with `##`, `###`, etc.
- Text, figures, illustrations, and equations.
- Videos: supported services include YouTube and Vimeo

```{r echo=FALSE, out.height = "75%", fig.align = "center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/learnr-narrative.png")
```

---

## Multiple choice questions

```{r eval=FALSE}
quiz(
  question("What position is the letter A in the english alphabet?",
    answer("8"),
    answer("14"),
    answer("1", correct = TRUE),
    answer("23"),
    incorrect = "See [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_alphabet) and try again.",
    allow_retry = TRUE
  ),

  question("Where are you right now? (select ALL that apply)",
    answer("Planet Earth", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Pluto"),
    answer("At a computing device", correct = TRUE),
    answer("In the Milky Way", correct = TRUE),
    incorrect = paste0("Incorrect. You're on Earth, ",
                       "in the Milky Way, at a computer.")
  )
)
```

- Deploy on
  - shinyapps.io (variety of pricing plans available)
  - RStudio Connect (free for academic use, requires setup)

.huge-text[Questions to Ponder]

---

class: middle

# What are my resources?

* Does your university have server time for hosting `learnr`/`shindig` tutorials?

--

* If not, does your university have funding sources to host these things elsewhere?  (e.g. shinyapps.io)

--

* Can you acquire funding for RStudio Cloud?  Can you charge students to use it?

--

* How much do **you** enjoy creating/teaching with R resources?

---

class: middle

# What are my learning objectives?

* If **learning R** is one of them... 

...students should probably have a native install!

--

* If **understanding how statisticians use code** is one of them ...

... consider `shindig` tutorials, `learnr` tutorials with pre-supplied code, or RS Cloud.

--

* If **software is not a learning objective**...

... consider using R as a back-end only, to make your own life easier.
